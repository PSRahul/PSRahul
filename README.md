I am passionate about machine learning systems, be it data exploration, model algorithmic research, or making the model ready to be served for inference. I am actively seeking job opportunities in India and welcome any exciting challenges in machine learning that I can contribute to. Feel free to reach out to me via email at psrahul.ml(at)gmail.com.
